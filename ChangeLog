  * Changed version to 0.2.2
  * Changed bullets to be loaded out of an xml config file simular to
    the way ships are loaded.  They the bullet_type is grabed from a
    list of bullet_types to get it's information.
  * Took out 3D sprite for a bit till I get a better rendering and some
    for the enemy ships.

  * Changed version to 0.2.1
  * Added in some simple command line argument support.  Help and 
    verbosity and version are added, along with the V_PRINT macro
    and some verbose output.  Added movement patterns for enemies and 
    tried a few of them out (Zig and Zag patterns).

  * Finally getting to the documentation.  Right now the game is
    at a nice beta stage.  I made the lists for enemies, bullets, 
    and explosions more robust.  Before they would on occasion
    give a SegFault.  Also killing an enemy will now make a ``BIG''
    explosion.
